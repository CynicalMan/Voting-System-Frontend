# Voting System

## Project Description

This project is a comprehensive voting system built using React and TypeScript, focusing on the development and utilization of reusable components. The application allows users to create, manage, and participate in various polls and elections. Designed with scalability and user experience in mind, this voting system features a modern and responsive user interface, ensuring accessibility across different devices.

### Key Features:
- **User Authentication**: Secure user login and registration system to ensure only authenticated users can create and participate in polls.
- **Poll Creation**: Easy-to-use interface for creating new polls, specifying multiple choices, and setting poll duration.
- **Admin Dashboard**: A comprehensive admin panel to manage users, polls, and monitor system activity.
- **Reusable Components**: Developed a library of reusable components for efficient and consistent UI development, enhancing code reusability and maintainability.
- **TypeScript Integration**: Leveraging TypeScript for type safety, enhanced code readability, and maintainability.

This project serves as a robust foundation for any voting application, offering extensibility and customization to fit specific needs. Ideal for educational institutions, organizations, and communities looking to implement a reliable and efficient voting solution with a focus on reusable components.

# React + TypeScript + Vite

This template provides a minimal setup to get React working in Vite with HMR and some ESLint rules.

Currently, two official plugins are available:

- [@vitejs/plugin-react](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react/blob/main/packages/plugin-react/README.md) uses [Babel](https://babeljs.io/) for Fast Refresh
- [@vitejs/plugin-react-swc](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react-swc) uses [SWC](https://swc.rs/) for Fast Refresh

## Expanding the ESLint configuration

If you are developing a production application, we recommend updating the configuration to enable type aware lint rules:

- Configure the top-level `parserOptions` property like this:

```js
export default {
  // other rules...
  parserOptions: {
    ecmaVersion: 'latest',
    sourceType: 'module',
    project: ['./tsconfig.json', './tsconfig.node.json'],
    tsconfigRootDir: __dirname,
  },
}
```

- Replace `plugin:@typescript-eslint/recommended` to `plugin:@typescript-eslint/recommended-type-checked` or `plugin:@typescript-eslint/strict-type-checked`
- Optionally add `plugin:@typescript-eslint/stylistic-type-checked`
- Install [eslint-plugin-react](https://github.com/jsx-eslint/eslint-plugin-react) and add `plugin:react/recommended` & `plugin:react/jsx-runtime` to the `extends` list
